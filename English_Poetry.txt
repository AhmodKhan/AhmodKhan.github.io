    It's been two decimal two decades _-_ We have been living Alone Together
    Agnoy of mind, I just wanted to share _-_ Talk little, shed tears and express my fear _-_ Needed to put off the burden and be free _-_ All I wanted was, you kept listening to me
    No matter what you say and show _-_ The truth very much, I do know

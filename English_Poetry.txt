It's been two decimal two decades _
We have been living Alone Together --

Agnoy of mind, I just wanted to share _
Talk little, shed tears and express my fear _
Needed to put off the burden and be free _
All I wanted was, you kept listening to me --

No matter what you say and show _
The truth very much, I do know --
